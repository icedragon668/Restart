+======================================+

On the 18th of April, 2019, I got sick. Not just a little sick either.

A LOT.

I had pneumonia. Or rather, the illness came to a head then. It had actually started about a week prior. That previous week I had been out of town. When I got back, I started feeling sick. It got worse and worse until that Thursday. I was so sick I could no longer code. The next three days were spent unable to eat. Drinking could only be achieved with great pain.

The road to recovery was slow, and filled with complications. Including severe secondary infections. I did try to continue on (the 30th), but to no avail.

After many treatments and therapies (some of which are ongoing), I am finally at a place to pick up where I left off.

But

After such a gap, I have lost my confidence. I am afraid people will look at this and judge me unfit. As such, I am beginning a new project: Restart

Restart is for me to redo everything I have done while also working on new ideas and materials. Rebuilding what time and illness have brought low.

Ultimately, this probably makes no difference. But it feels important to me.

<!-- From Disposable Profile 12th 9 2019
    I am finding this restart to be a good refresher.
     I think I either forgot, or never learned the href=#.
      And is helping me with notation. Both in the code
       and in the commits (notation is lacking here,
        at least for a "first" project. That will have to be ammended)

I should also like to get some markdown under my belt. I never did get around to practicing that

<!-- From Basic CSS Page 2 13th 9 2019
    Not much relearning was gained in this project

<!-- From Disposable Profile 13th 9 2019
    altered a strong tag to a span with inline style
    good reminder about inline style and elements

Just now thought about adding a universal reset.css to this project
While having one per project makes sense elsewhere, here I only need the one
