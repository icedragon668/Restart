+======================================+

On the 18th of April, 2019, I got sick. Not just a little sick either.

A LOT.

I had pneumonia. Or rather, the illness came to a head then. It had actually started about a week prior. That previous week I had been out of town. When I got back, I started feeling sick. It got worse and worse until that Thursday. I was so sick I could no longer code. The next three days were spent unable to eat. Drinking could only be achieved with great pain.

The road to recovery was slow, and filled with complications. Including severe secondary infections. I did try to continue on (the 30th), but to no avail.

After many treatments and therapies (some of which are ongoing), I am finally at a place to pick up where I left off.

But

After such a gap, I have lost my confidence. I am afraid people will look at this and judge me unfit. As such, I am beginning a new project: Restart

Restart is for me to redo everything I have done while also working on new ideas and materials. Rebuilding what time and illness have brought low.

Ultimately, this probably makes no difference. But it feels important to me.
