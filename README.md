+======================================+

On the 18th of April, 2019, I got sick. Not just a little sick either.

A LOT.

I had pneumonia. Or rather, the illness came to a head then. It had actually started about a week prior. That previous week I had been out of town. When I got back, I started feeling sick. It got worse and worse until that Thursday. I was so sick I could no longer code. The next three days were spent unable to eat. Drinking could only be achieved with great pain.

The road to recovery was slow, and filled with complications. Including severe secondary infections. I did try to continue on (the 30th), but to no avail.

After many treatments and therapies (some of which are ongoing), I am finally at a place to pick up where I left off.

But

After such a gap, I have lost my confidence. I am afraid people will look at this and judge me unfit. As such, I am beginning a new project: Restart

Restart is for me to redo everything I have done while also working on new ideas and materials. Rebuilding what time and illness have brought low.

Ultimately, this probably makes no difference. But it feels important to me.

<!-- From Disposable Profile 12th 9 2019
    I am finding this restart to be a good refresher.
     I think I either forgot, or never learned the href=#.
      And is helping me with notation. Both in the code
       and in the commits (notation is lacking here,
        at least for a "first" project. That will have to be ammended)
-->

I should also like to get some markdown under my belt. I never did get around to practicing that

<!-- From Basic CSS Page 2 13th 9 2019
    Not much relearning was gained in this project
-->

<!-- From Disposable Profile 13th 9 2019
    altered a strong tag to a span with inline style
    good reminder about inline style and elements
-->

Come back
<!-- From Fun with Divs 16th 9 2019
    working with siblings in css should be a common exercise
    space > ~ + , (add names)
-->

Come Back to This
<!-- Relative Paths 18th 9 2019
    added some notes for CSS switching that I want to get back to
-->

Just now thought about adding a universal reset.css to this project
While having one per project makes sense elsewhere, here I only need the one

<!-- From Boxes 18th 9 2019
    Review Box-Sizing more closely
    Got distracted and did the "only commit once" error
    Must try to make multiple commits as practice for larger projects
    The idea is to track changes
     not to just save the current project
-->

ToDo: Read up on clearfix
<!-- Week One of Restart
    After one week, I feel much better. My goal is to in crease commits to 20 daily. This will likely mean two small projects a day.
    I am excited to be coding again. It feels good.
-->

<!-- From Positions 19th 9 2019
    Got a late start, may not make 20 commits "today"
    Will not overage here once finished for the "day"
    No overage! but only managed one project today.
    Need to remember to start a little bit earlier.
-->

! ToDo: Read up on Mixins
<!-- From Pseudo and Columns Bootstrap 20th 9 2019
    This has the makings of some useful CSS tricks.
    I would like to combine the display:none with an animation later
-->

! ToDo: decipher and DIY a bootstrap navbar
<!-- from Navbar and Media Queries 23rd 9 2019
    I should very much like to design my own navbar from the ground up
    Ditto to "pop-ups", whose name I have forgotten. (24/9/19: modal)
    It's good to read through the bootstrap css as linked in the source. I find that more valuable than the actual documentation.

    Media Queries are straight forward, if not easy to fully implement across multiple devices.
    It would be a good idea to develop a standard media query testing strategy
-->

! Todo: Better learn RegEx
<!-- from JS Intro 24th 9 2019
    I'm okay with JS, but rusty with some of the basics. I'm looking forward to doing the JS30 challenge soon.
