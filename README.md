# Restart
I  go really sick. This is my restart

# +======================================+

On the 18th of April, 2019, I got sick. Not just a little sick either.

**A LOT.**

I had pneumonia. Or rather, the illness came to a head then. It had actually started about a week prior. That previous week I had been out of town. When I got back, I started feeling sick. It got worse and worse until that Thursday. I was so sick I could no longer code. The next three days were spent unable to eat. Drinking could only be achieved with great pain.

The road to recovery was slow, and filled with complications. Including severe secondary infections. I did try to continue on (the 30th), but to no avail.

After many treatments and therapies (some of which are ongoing), I am finally at a place to pick up where I left off.

*But*

After such a gap, I have lost my confidence. I am afraid people will look at this and judge me unfit. As such, I am beginning a new project: Restart

Restart is for me to redo everything I have done while also working on new ideas and materials. Rebuilding what time and illness have brought low.

Ultimately, this probably makes no difference. But it feels important to me.


## From Disposable Profile 12th 9 2019
    I am finding this restart to be a good refresher.
    I think I either forgot, or never learned the href=#.
    And is helping me with notation. Both in the code
    and in the commits (notation is lacking here,
    at least for a "first" project. That will have to be
    amended)

    I should also like to get some markdown under my belt.
    I never did get around to practicing that


## From Basic CSS Page 2 13th 9 2019
    Not much relearning was gained in this project


## From Disposable Profile 13th 9 2019
    altered a strong tag to a span with inline style
    good reminder about inline style and elements


## From Fun with Divs 16th 9 2019
    working with siblings in css should be a common exercise
    space > ~ + , (add names)
#### Come back

## Relative Paths 18th 9 2019
    added some notes for CSS switching that I want to get
    back to
#### Come Back to This


Just now thought about adding a universal reset.css to this project
While having one per project makes sense elsewhere, here I only need the one

## From Boxes 18th 9 2019
    Got distracted and did the "only commit once" error
    Must try to make multiple commits as practice for 
    larger projects

    The idea is to track changes
    not to just save the current project
#### ToDo: Review Box-Sizing more closely


## Week One of Restart
    After one week, I feel much better. My goal is to 
    increase commits to 20 daily. This will likely mean 
    two small projects a day.
    
    I am excited to be coding again. It feels good.


## From Positions 19th 9 2019
    Got a late start, may not make 20 commits "today"
    Will not overage here once finished for the "day"
    No overage! but only managed one project today.
    Need to remember to start a little bit earlier.


## From Pseudo and Columns Bootstrap 20th 9 2019
    This has the makings of some useful CSS tricks.
    I would like to combine the display:none with an 
    animation later
#### ToDo: Read up on Mixins


## from Navbar and Media Queries 23rd 9 2019
    I should very much like to design my own navbar from 
    the ground up
    
    Ditto to "pop-ups", whose name I have forgotten. 
    (24/9/19: modal)
    
    It's good to read through the bootstrap css as linked 
    in the source. I find that more valuable than the 
    actual documentation.

    Media Queries are straight forward, if not easy to 
    fully implement across multiple devices.

    It would be a good idea to develop a standard media 
    query testing strategy
#### ToDo: decipher and DIY a bootstrap navbar


## from JS Intro 24th 9 2019
    I'm okay with JS, but rusty with some of the basics. 
    I'm looking forward to doing the JS30 challenge soon.
#### Todo: Better learn RegEx


## Reading up on clearfix
    .group:after {
        content: "";
        display: table;
        clear: both;
    }
    ::after sticks this stuff at the end of the element, okay.
    
    content: ""; add a nothing, kinda like a cleaning :p
    clear: both; stops the floating, but of the next element, 
    so watch that placing.
    
    display: table; not really up on this, it is it's own 
    rabbit hole.
    
     but there is a lot of good stuff here
     ah! the display: table is a height hack! 
     prevents the element from collapsing.
    
    A good way to go seems to be to put floats in a 
    parent and give the parent the clearfix. 
    (specifically .clearfix:after)
    
    .group is considered the more popular name now 
    (.group:after)

    flexbox is next on the study list
    display is worth a reading as well (w3s should be fine)
     the Kicking Ass with Display bookmark is awesome
#### ToDo: read up on flexbox
#### ToDo: read up on general display (and specifically table)


## from JS ACL 25th 9 2019
    I could do with going back here, if only to touch up 
    a couple spots
    
    I'd like to add some verification, but i know i'll 
    be doing that soon enough.

    Some JSX and some RegEx are in order, as well as 
    new (const name = new type(arguments)).
#### Notice: Rabbit Holes


## 26 9 2019: Conditions and Functions
    was a bit sloppy tonight
    in part because i didn't take the time to do these 
    the way i'd like to do them
    
    but that is no excuse
    not a great effort today


## 27 9 2019: Objects and DOM
    i did not finish the project like i wanted to, 
    will come back to this
    
    a bit disappointed with myself tonight, again?
    
    i need to start earlier, i think that is the main 
    difference from the past two days
    
    but I hit may goals... so it's still good. i just 
    have higher expectations of myself


## 30 9 2019: Objects and DOM, day 2
    Not on my list for today, but I still feel a little 
    bad that I couldn't pull from forms from memory :p
    
    looking forward to stopping alert/prompt and doing 
    DOM manipulation
    
    All in all, a fine day. just not above and beyond


## 1 10 2019: DOM Library
    this was a pretty good run, save that nonsense on 
    the first part...
    
    I feel much more confident here. hopefully, when i 
    get to jQuery, i'll be able to skip it and use vanilla
    (or rather vanilla THEN jQuery)
    
    still getting used to 'git commit -am' lol


## 2 10 2019: Fun Stuff - RPGy
    built a small game frame. it does next to nothing 
    right now.
    
    most of what's in here will likely be taken out too
    ...
    but it works and was fun to do! i think i needed 
    to do something fun


## 3 10 2019: An SPA
    I well overestimated this lesson; the hardest part 
    was the css
    
    ::RPGy
    practice with shape drawing in canvas...
    not exactly what I had intended to do, but good all 
    the same
    
    the pathing feels similar to SVG, with some difference 
    of course


## 4 10 2019: DOMing
    the hard parts were getting the value off the button
    w/o jQuery
    
    and I could use more css practice
    nothing too notable

## 8 10 2019: Calculator
    This is a good exercise to come back to. There is a 
    lot that CAN be done to make a better calculator.
    
    I would like to make this into an app, it's an easy 
    concept. Plus a good way to navigate app creation 
    (Swift, ReactNative, etc.)
#### ToDo: Come Back Here


## 8 10 2019: Data and Scope
    digging through the data was a fine exercise, a bit 
    more interesting for being vanilla sans dom.js

    maybe i should refactor something like this to make 
    it nice? reduce those long noodles and re-usable 
    functions...
    
    well, I refactored it...
    it was good exercise i guess?

## 9 10 2019: Canvas Bumpy
    a sprite walks around a small canvas!
    next to add a scrolling map beneath, and if time 
    permits, obstacles!


## 10 10 2019: Timers and Calls
    seems the server for this exercise is down
    otherwise uneventful
    got to try fetch() ! seems okay, but 403, so dunno
    
    *15.10.2019 Update* The API is not working as is
    Whether this is an update, or it's just broken...
    I just haven't bothered to find out


## 11 10 2019: Canvas Bumpy
    found a different project. the difference between the 
    2 are significant. 3 if you count Small Game. Now the 
    test will be to integrate all of them

    next: combine with RPGy text spaces
    then: events!
#### ToDo: Continue


## 14 10 2019: APIing
    I want to get better with async and await functions

    this lesson requires more refactoring

    got the api calls working as hoped, using only fetch()

    the DOM portion of this lesson is not yet finished
    while not huge, I would like to review the data-attr
    portion
#### ToDo: Learn async and await


## 15 10 2019: Review data-attr
    Review of data-* attributes. nice! get them with a 
    selector.dataset.* 
    
    eg:
     <div id="tester" data-tester="1234">
    document.querySelector("#tester").dataset.tester // "1234"
    or CSS
    [data-tester="1234"] { //some style }


#### important: mark down language, this format is bad...
/*[About READMEs](https://help.github.com/articles/about-readmes/)*/

/* [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)*/
*15.10.2019 Update* format is getting better!


## 15 10 2019: APIing
    i'm missing something about event listeners that are
    created later.
    
    jQuery .on has a selector to listen to a parent, 
    then select from there, but i'm having a hard time 
    recreating it in vanilla 

*16.10.2019 Update*
    Found it! see below (event delegation)

#### ToDo: Continue
*I need to step away from this*


## 16 10 2019: New Tricks
    Performance testing! Just a simple way to clock time of code
    
```javascript
console.time("start")
//do stuff
console.timeEnd("end") // eg: "end: 1234.54ms"
```
    Or
```javascript
let start = performance.now()
//do stuff
let end = performance.now()
console.log(`This took ${end-start} ms`)
```
    Then there's the whole page listener: EVENT DELEGATION
```javascript
const eventDelegation = function(e) {
    e.preventDefault()                   //just good practice
    if (e.target.matches('.selector')){  //switch case?
        //do stuff for that selector
    }
}

document.addEventListener('click', eventDelegation)
```

## 17 10 2019: Node and Exports
    less of a lesson, more a review
    straightforward
#### ToDo: git commit -m typo fixes
#### ToDo: 04/05 Project


## 18 10 2019: PackageJSON (and server GET)
    well, there's more to the package.json then this got into
    I'm just not sure where the issues I am thinking of are

    then went on to server GET method. pretty easy stuff
    a little unclear with the params call though

    UPDATE: solved!
    the params bit, well i was just reading it wrong
    there is that error still, but it gives me something very different
#### ToDo: Learn excpetions


## 21 10 2019: Hiatus
    Over the next week or two, I will have limited access and 
    time due to family commitments

    Hopefully this will not impact my activity. But I
    doubt I'll get away with as much

## 21 10 2019: PackageJSON (and server REST)
    I have not finished the REST routes, and am currently 
    out of time

    This is the sort of thing I was hoping to avoid:
    INCOMPLETES

    Ah well, only thing I can do is keep at it


## 28 10 2019: Return from Hiatus
    I am back! I started doing some freeCodeCamp.org. Not sure how,
    or if, i want to incorporate that here.
    
    I keep NOT finding the open source contributions... I get close
    then I get sidetracked. This time by a palindrome checker lol


## 28 10 2019: SQL - the Begining
    some basic SQL, nothing too interesting. current_timestamp
    instead of current_date, but thats about it


## 30 10 2019: More SQL
    yesterday was all SQL. I didn't even feel the need to 
    update here. today, getting into foreign keys and joins
    i think i should keep track, as this is where i remember 
    getting confused the first time through

    the HAVING keyword warrants a little better understanding
    as does the grouping and naming

    I think I've got most of this down. But tying to get a better
    understanding of HOW count works
    I THINK count(*) is based on Group By
    No groups counts everything
    Group By defines different "rows", then counts them
#### ToDo: SQL - HAVING, AS, DESC, count(*) AS Count


## 31 10 2019: More SQL
    the lesson itself was fairly easy. the "hard" part being that i missed
    a third table being added in and getting ahead of myself while aliasing


## 31 10 2019: SQL additional study
    foriegn keys are not really necessary, just helpful. used to ensure 
    refrential integrity. ie, can't refrence something that isn't there.

    section 2 , query 3 of More SQL/airline JOINs flights is a good example
    of as/aliasing. it turns out that AS can be replaced (left out actually),
    but until i'm more comfortable, it's staying in. AS can be used to pull the
    same information to different parts of the same query. eg "source" and 
    "dest" both have "names", by ASing them with a1.name and a2.name, they
    can both be joined.

### Next: unit06
