I  go really sick. This is my restart

+======================================+

On the 18th of April, 2019, I got sick. Not just a little sick either.

A LOT.

I had pneumonia. Or rather, the illness came to a head then. It had actually started about a week prior. That previous week I had been out of town. When I got back, I started feeling sick. It got worse and worse until that Thursday. I was so sick I could no longer code. The next three days were spent unable to eat. Drinking could only be achieved with great pain.

The road to recovery was slow, and filled with complications. Including severe secondary infections. I did try to continue on (the 30th), but to no avail.

After many treatments and therapies (some of which are ongoing), I am finally at a place to pick up where I left off.

But

After such a gap, I have lost my confidence. I am afraid people will look at this and judge me unfit. As such, I am beginning a new project: Restart

Restart is for me to redo everything I have done while also working on new ideas and materials. Rebuilding what time and illness have brought low.

Ultimately, this probably makes no difference. But it feels important to me.

<!-- From Disposable Profile 12th 9 2019
    I am finding this restart to be a good refresher.
     I think I either forgot, or never learned the href=#.
      And is helping me with notation. Both in the code
       and in the commits (notation is lacking here,
        at least for a "first" project. That will have to be ammended)
-->

I should also like to get some markdown under my belt. I never did get around to practicing that

<!-- From Basic CSS Page 2 13th 9 2019
    Not much relearning was gained in this project
-->

<!-- From Disposable Profile 13th 9 2019
    altered a strong tag to a span with inline style
    good reminder about inline style and elements
-->

Come back
<!-- From Fun with Divs 16th 9 2019
    working with siblings in css should be a common exercise
    space > ~ + , (add names)
-->

Come Back to This
<!-- Relative Paths 18th 9 2019
    added some notes for CSS switching that I want to get back to
-->

Just now thought about adding a universal reset.css to this project
While having one per project makes sense elsewhere, here I only need the one

ToDo: Review Box-Sizing more closely
<!-- From Boxes 18th 9 2019
    Got distracted and did the "only commit once" error
    Must try to make multiple commits as practice for larger projects
    The idea is to track changes
     not to just save the current project
-->

<!-- Week One of Restart
    After one week, I feel much better. My goal is to in crease commits to 20 daily. This will likely mean two small projects a day.
    I am excited to be coding again. It feels good.
-->

<!-- From Positions 19th 9 2019
    Got a late start, may not make 20 commits "today"
    Will not overage here once finished for the "day"
    No overage! but only managed one project today.
    Need to remember to start a little bit earlier.
-->

! ToDo: Read up on Mixins
<!-- From Pseudo and Columns Bootstrap 20th 9 2019
    This has the makings of some useful CSS tricks.
    I would like to combine the display:none with an animation later
-->

! ToDo: decipher and DIY a bootstrap navbar
<!-- from Navbar and Media Queries 23rd 9 2019
    I should very much like to design my own navbar from the ground up
    Ditto to "pop-ups", whose name I have forgotten. (24/9/19: modal)
    It's good to read through the bootstrap css as linked in the source. I find that more valuable than the actual documentation.

    Media Queries are straight forward, if not easy to fully implement across multiple devices.
    It would be a good idea to develop a standard media query testing strategy
-->

Todo: Better learn RegEx
<!-- from JS Intro 24th 9 2019
    I'm okay with JS, but rusty with some of the basics. I'm looking forward to doing the JS30 challenge soon.
-->

ToDo: read up on flexbox
ToDo: read up on general display (and specifically table)
<!-- Reading up on clearfix
    .group:after {
        content: "";
        display: table;
        clear: both;
    }
    ::after sticks this stuff at the end of the element, okay.
    content: ""; add a nothing, kinda like a cleaning :p
    clear: both; stops the floating, but of the next element, so watch that placing.
    display: table; not really up on this, it is it's own rabbit hole.
     but there is a lot of good stuff here
     ah! the display: table is a height hack! prevents the element from collapsing.
    
    A good way to go seems to be to put floats in a parent and give the parent the clearfix. (specifically .clearfix:after)
    .group is considered the more popular name now (.group:after)

    flexbox is next on the study list
    display is worth a reading as well (w3s should be fine)
     the Kicking Ass with Display bookmark is awesome
-->

Notice: Rabbit Holes
<!-- from JS ACL 25th 9 2019
    I could do with going back here, if only to touch up a couple spots
    I'd like to add some verification, but i know i'll be doing that soon enough.
    Some JSX and some RegEx are in order, as well as new (const name = new type(arguments)).
-->

<!-- 26 9 2019: Conditions and Functions
    was a bit sloppy tonight
    in part because i didnt take the time to do these the way i'd like to do them
    but that is no excuse
    not a great effort today
-->

<!-- 27 9 2019: Objects and DOM
    i did not finish the project like i wanted to, will come back to this
    a bit disappointed with myself tonight, again?
    i need to start earlier, i think that is the main difference from the past two days
    but I hit may goals... so it's still good. i just have higher expectations of myself
-->

<!-- 30 9 2019: Objects and DOM, day 2
    Not on my list for today, but I still feel a little bad that I couldn't pull from forms from memory :p
    looking forward to stopping alert/prompt and doing DOM manipulation
    All in all, a fine day. just not above and beyond
-->

<!-- 1 10 2019: DOM Library
    this was a pretty good run, save that nonsense on the first part...
    I feel much more confident here. hopefull, when i get to jQuery, i'll be able to skip it and use vanilla
    (or rather vanilla THEN jQuery)
      still getting used to 'git commit -am' lol
-->

<!-- 2 10 2019: Fun Stuff - RPGy
    built a small game frame. it does next to nothing right now.
    most of whats in here will likely be taken out too
    ...
    but it works and was fun to do! i think i needed to do something fun
-->

<!-- 3 10 2019: An SPA
    I well overestimated this lesson; the hardest part was the css
    
    ::RPGy
    practice with shape drawing in canvas...
    not exactly what I had intended to do, but good all the same
    the pathing feels similar to SVG, with some difference of course
-->

<!-- 4 10 2019: DOMing
    the hard parts were getting the value off the button w/o jQuery
    and I could use more css practice
    nothing too notable
-->
ToDo: Come Back Here
<!-- 8 10 2019: Calculator
    This is a good exercise to come back to. There is a lot that CAN be done to make a better calculator.
    I would like to make this into an app, it's an easy concept. Plus a good way to navigate app creation (Swift, ReactNative, etc.)
-->
<!-- 8 10 2019: Data and Scope
    digging through the data was a fine exercise, a bit more interesting for being vanilla sans dom.js
    maybe i should refactor something like this to make it nice? reduce those long noodles and re-usable functions...
    well, I refactored it...
    it was good exercise i guess?
-->
<!-- 9 10 2019: Canvas Bumpy
    a sprite walks around a small canvas!
    next to add a scrolling map beneath, and if time permits, obstacles!
-->

<!-- 10 10 2019: Timers and Calls
    seems the server for this exercise is down
    otherwise uneventful
    got to try fetch() ! seems okay, but 403, so dunno
-->

ToDo: Continue
<!-- 11 10 2019: Canvas Bumpy
    found a different project. the difference between the 2 are significant. 3 if you count Small Game. Now the test will be to integrate all of them

    next: combine with RPGY text spaces
    then: events!
-->

ToDo: Learn async and await
<!-- 14 10 2019: APIing
    I want to get better with async and await functions

    this lesson requires more refactoring

    got the api calls working as hoped, using only fetch()

    the DOM portion of this lesson is not yet finished
    while not huge, I would like to review the data-attr portion
-->

<!-- 15 10 2019: Review data-attr
    Review of data-* attributes. nice! get them with a selector.dataset.* 
    eg:
     <div id="tester" data-tester="1234">
    document.querySelector("#tester").dataset.tester // "1234"
    or CSS
    [data-tester="1234"] { //some style }

-->
important: mark down language, this format is bad...
Next: unit03/04 cont.
