//Block 1
const classList = ['Math', 'Science', 'English', 'Music', 'Intro to Programming', 'Basketweaving'];
/*
Using the given `classList` array: 

1. Prompt the user for the name of a class they would like to update.
2. Prompt the user for a new class name.
3. Replace the old class name with the new one.

## Challenge:

Do the above without writing a for loop.
*/

/* Block 2
Prompt the user for a username and store the response in a variable.

Prompt the user for a password and store this data.

If the `username` equals "admin" and the `password` equals "1234", then alert "Welcome to the admin page".

If the `username` equals "average joe" and the `password` equals "jsRocks", then alert "Welcome to the user landing page".

Otherwise alert "Invalid username and password, refresh the page to try again"
*/

/* Block 3
Start by creating a new function called `multiplyFunc`.

`multiplyFunc` should take in one parameter. 

Within the code block, you should simply console log out the parameter.

Finally, call your function passing in any argument you wish.

## Challenge

Re-write the `multiplyFunc` so that it will console log the taken parameter multiplied by `3`.
*/

/* Block 4
Open your editor and create a file named `function.js`.

In this activity we will create 3 functions.

1. Our first function will accept 1 parameter (a number) and multiply it by itself and return the new value.
2. Our next function will accept 2 parameters (both strings: a first name and a last name) and return the name in the following format: lastName, firstName. 
  * e.g. given the arguments ("Arya", "Stark"), the function should return "Stark, Arya".
3. Our last function will accept 1 parameter (number) and return a boolean: true if the number is even, and false if the number is false.

Be sure to call all of your functions after defining them and log all of your results in the console.
